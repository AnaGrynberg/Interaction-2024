<h1> Question 1 </h1>

I took an Interaction class last semester where we were exposed to HTML/CSS/JS and I enjoyed it when we had the freedom to explore creative ways to make our website visually appealing. It was nice when we explored it together in class. When we got to Java Script things got more confusing and I also had some questions on how to make my site responsive.

<h1> Question 2 </h1>

I'm very excited to be proficient in coding and hope to start enjoying creating my code. Maybe having some tutorials in class and working together on some code can be very helpful, as well as having some one-on-one time to help us with bugs and questions on our websites.

<h1> Question 3 </h1>

I believe that coding will come very much in handy in my design curriculum. Even though I don't expect to continue to code various websites or as a career, having this knowledge will be very good for finding interesting jobs and knowing the language when talking with my colleagues. Other than that, coding is part of the future and I want to be able to understand it!

<h1> Question 4 </h1>

Most of the time I just use Grammarly or the Computer corrector.

<h1> Question 5 </h1>

I used Github in my last class to upload my work. From my understanding, Github is a Hub where all the code/images/data of your website will be stored, so you can share the link with others and they will be able to access your site.

<h1> Question 6 </h1>
